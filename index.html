                <p>Apparently Leos and Virgos are supposed to be an unlikely match. Leos are flamboyant and extroverted while Virgos are quiet and shy which makes getting past the initial stage of the relationship hard.</p>
                <p>As a Leo myself I beg to differ. Whenever you hear about Leos you usually hear the same words, flamboyant, outgoing, extroverted, stubborn, melodramatic but not all Leos present that way. Some are actually quite the opposite, I myself tend to lean toward the other side of the scale. I present as a more introverted person certainly not flamboyant that being said I do have Leo qualities. I admit being melodramatic is in my nature, I can also be a bit stubborn but also level-headed to know when to admit when I’m at fault. Virgos are usually described as analytical, precise, inflexible, cold. Here’s the thing though, from my personal experience, I have only witnessed the analytical aspect of Virgos and despite being analytical they’re far away from being judgmental. I most definitely don’t think they’re inflexible or cold, quite the opposite in fact. I believe they’re spontaneous, warm, fun, always ready for a new adventure when possible and that’s just scratching the surface about how awesome Virgos can be.</p>
                <p>I believe Virgos and Leos can complement and complete each other. They both appreciate intelligence, they’re both known to be loyal to their families and loved ones and are reliable. </p>
                <p>Take that as it may, all of this doesn’t actually matter. If you take horoscopes as a definitive guide you have a bigger problem that compatibility. Just remember that we’re all human beings with different opinions and experiences that tend to shape us. Respect each other, protect each other, listen to each other and most definitely don’t be judgmental of each other. </p>
