                <p>Apparently Leos and Virgos are supposed to be an unlikely match. 
                    Leos are flamboyant and extroverted while Virgos are quiet and shy which makes getting past the initial stage of the relationship hard
                    on the contrary they can have a strong bond, 
                    some might say that is it’s a chemical bond (who says that :P).
                </p>
                <p>Whenever you hear about Leos you usually hear the same words, flamboyant, outgoing, extroverted, stubborn, melodramatic but not all Leos present that way. 
                    Some are actually quite the opposite, I myself tend to lean toward the other side of the scale. 
                    I present as a more introverted person certainly not flamboyant, that being said I do have Leo qualities. 
                    I can be melodramatic, I can also be a bit stubborn but also level-headed to know when to admit when I’m at fault. 
                    Virgos are usually described as analytical, Observant, loyal, Helpful. 
                    They can be analytical but  they are far away from being judgmental. 
                    They’re also spontaneous, warm, fun, always ready for new adventures and certainly dependable. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe Virgos and Leos can complement each other. 
                    They tend to appreciate intelligence, they are both known for their loyalty to their families and loved ones and are generally reliable. 
                    You know they’ll always be there when needed the most. 
                    They can also learn from each other for that they appreciate proper communication and sharing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take that as it may, all of this doesn’t actually matter. 
                    If you take horoscopes as a definitive guide you have a bigger problem that compatibility. 
                    Just remember that we’re all human beings with different opinions and experiences that tend to shape us. 
                    Respect each other, protect each other, listen to each other and most definitely don’t be judgmental of each other.
